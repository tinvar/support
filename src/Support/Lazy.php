/**
 * A Data field whose value is produced on demand. Codegen maps `Lazy<T>` to
 * `Promise<T>` in TypeScript.
 *
 * Phase 0 resolves these during encoding. Streaming an unresolved Lazy to the
 * renderer as a real promise is Level 3 lazy loading (tinvar-spec.md, "Lazy
 * loading") and belongs to a later phase.
 *
 * A Lazy made inside a scope set up by within() -- the ORM's readOnly(), for
 * a loader or query body -- resolves under that scope too. The encoder
 * resolves it after the body has returned and the read-only transaction has
 * ended, so without this its resolver could write during a GET, and during a
 * prefetch on hover.
 *
 * A resolver that throws fails the payload it is in, unless the field is
 * marked #[Rescue]: then the failure is reported and the field is sent as a
 * Rescued marker instead (the encoder's rescue(), ADR 0017). The mark is on the
 * field and not here, so codegen can see it.
